# Small-weather-station-project
Using a  BMP280 sensor, a small OLED screen, and an arduino uno R4, this portable "device" takes temprature,humidity and pressure and graphs them over 24H.
This was made in order to help you "predict" the weather (in an extremely limited sense) by changes in the pressure readings, as well as see as how pressure,temperature, and humidity changed over the course of the day, and help you see what to expect.
